# Context
Alright so, for quick context for this year's freedom project. I am using the tool called "Phaser" and you can learn more about my tool
here. And for the topic of this year freedom project, I decided that I'll go with game creation of dungeon. Last year I went a little passive and focused mainly on animation. Like on the surface level. However this year I wanted to go a little more in-depth. My idea of dunegon game is that as each level you progress goes higher and higher the level also games progressly harder and harder and you can select what weapons you used, characters you choose, and mobs involved. And yea that's the whole context. But let me say this right now, I won't be discussing any of the game creation using phaser tool yet. But more so of what I learn from it, how I tinkered with my tools and etc. But probably by next learning log I will somewhat be discussing about partial of the game.
# Content
Alright so for content. There were many tools to decide on, however to me I felt like if I wanted to design an dunegon game that is functional and fun the choices can be limited. Even though I didn't have an chance to 100% try out all of the tools my teacher presented me with. To me I feel like its pretty limited. The reason is because I feel like the choice is either between GDevelop or Phaser. Originally I was going to go with GDevelop becasue it looked more advanced and more easier to work with. However upon looking at some of the tutorial and the documentation I'm kind of glad I didn't confirm it. The reason is I feel like GDevelop is more complicated then most people think and doesn't have like an built in setting like Phaser. So I choose phaser as my final option. Overall phaser looks like an less complicated and more easier tool to both tinker and use the tool with.
# Engineering Designing Process 
Alright so for as of right now, where I am at for the engineering designing process is a bit weird. Because and since my topic is focused on creating an game that is dungeon type. Where as each level it progressly gets harder and harder. I'm not even up to designing the game yet. The problem is the first step is "identifying an problem" however the problem IS that I don't HAVE an problem currently to identify, because I'm still somewhat learning about my tool of phaser. Right now I'm still following through the documentation tutorials listed within the phaser website. But all in all, I don't have an problem I can identify as of right now. Meaning I'm still stuck at the first step. But by the next blog I hope to actually identify an problem in which I can solve and research of how to solve that problem.

# Skills
## Basic Programming Skills
<ul>
  <li>Can learn conditionals, for example</li>
  
  ```js 
  let score = 10;

if (score > 5) {
    console.log("Good Job");
} else {
    console.log("Try Again!");
}
```
<li>Letting the score be 10, if score is over than 5 than says good job, otherwise says try again</li>
<li>Functions, for example </li>

```js
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("Alex");  
```
<li>The parameters has name, and the argument passsed is alex, so in the console.log it would say Hello, Alex!</li>
<li>And also variables (Which is self explantory)</li>
</ul>

### Researching And Gathering Information
<li>Using phaser allows the user to break the game which is an large chunk --> and digest it into much smalller steps which is more manageable and not overwhelming</li>
<li>Testing codes, using <a href="https://jsbin.com/">in Jsbin</a>and testing out the outcomes. Basically it allows the user to think, and predict instead of thinking it works "100% of the times"</li>
<li>Allows the user to experiment with different set of codes, and solutions</li>
