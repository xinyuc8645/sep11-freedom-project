# Context
Alright so, for quick context for this year's freedom project. I am using the tool called "Phaser" and you can learn more about my tool (https://docs.phaser.io/phaser-editor/intro/welcome)here]

# Engineering Designing Process 
Alright so for as of right now, where I am at for the engineering designing process is a bit weird. Because and since my topic is focused on creating an game that is dungeon type. Where as each level it progressly gets harder and harder. I'm not even up to designing the game yet. The problem is the first step is "identifying an problem" however the problem IS that I don't HAVE an problem currently to identify, because I'm still somewhat learning about my tool of phaser. Right now I'm still following through the documentation tutorials listed within the phaser website. But all in all, I don't have an problem I can identify as of right now. Meaning I'm still stuck at the first step. But by the next blog I hope to actually identify an problem in which I can solve and research of how to solve that problem.

# Skills
## Basic Programming Skills
<ul>
  <li>Can learn conditionals, for example</li>
  
  ```js 
  let score = 10;

if (score > 5) {
    console.log("Good Job");
} else {
    console.log("Try Again!");
}
```
<li>Letting the score be 10, if score is over than 5 than says good job, otherwise says try again</li>
<li>Functions, for example </li>

```js
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("Alex");  
```
<li>The parameters has name, and the argument passsed is alex, so in the console.log it would say Hello, Alex!</li>
<li>And also variables (Which is self explantory)</li>
</ul>

### Researching And Gathering Information
<li>Using phaser allows the user to break the game which is an large chunk --> and digest it into much smalller steps which is more manageable and not overwhelming</li>
<li>Testing codes, using <a href="https://jsbin.com/">in Jsbin</a>and testing out the outcomes. Basically it allows the user to think, and predict instead of thinking it works "100% of the times"</li>
<li>Allows the user to experiment with different set of codes, and solutions</li>
