### 9/29/25: Getting started
<ul>
<li>From the website doc for <a href= "https://docs.phaser.io/phaser/getting-started/installation">phaser installing</a>  the cdn link is in the following:</li>

  ```js
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.86.0/dist/phaser.js"></script>
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.86.0/dist/phaser.min.js"></script>
```
<li>Have to include either one in my html from my ide</li>
<li>Ok so, base off of, the youtube videos I've watched many codes from phaser including basic tutorials has to be basically downloaded and get the code from that template, because you cannot just randomly create a code with no knowledge.</li>
<li>Refer back to this <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqMIGGy5YiE&list=PLmcXe0-sfoShHpVWLDW2gqsyH1UFRni_2">youtube video</a>
For now, I'll be studying and testing my tool for basics; refer back to the video playlist of <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFXx7lgxK9A&list=PLDyH9Tk5ZdFzEu_izyqgPFtHJJXkc79no&index=2">"Phaser Tutorials"</a>
<li>For configuring a shape, in this case or something, and wanting to adjust height, weight just type height: and weight:</li>
<li>Create a variable called </li>

```js
var configuration {
height: 100,
weight: 500,
}
```
<li>Basically just like the html code,  but in js we have to create a variabble, so we can modify it.</li>
<li>And we save all of that code into the game scenes</li>

```js
var newGame = Phaser.game(configuration);
```
  
</ul>
